## Executive Summary

This project tests how fast a computer can multiply a large 4000x4000 matrix using four different methods:

1. **Sequential CPU**: Using a single processor core.
2. **OpenMP**: Using 8 processor cores on a single computer.
3. **MPI**: Using 4 separate virtual machines connected over a network.
4. **CUDA**: Using a graphics card (GPU) to do the math.

The main goal is to show how parallel computing reduces execution time compared to a standard sequential program.

---

## 1.  Experiment Objectives

- **Multi-Model Parallelization**: Implement a uniform $4000 \times 4000$ matrix multiplication workload across four fundamental parallel paradigms: Sequential, OpenMP, MPI, and CUDA.
- **Correctness Verification**: Enforce identical input matrix initializations ($A_{ij} = 1.0, B_{ij} = 1.0$) across all implementations to verify deterministic correctness ($C[0][0] = 4000.00$).
- **Parallel Performance Evaluation**: Quantify speedup gains obtained by migrating from single-core CPU execution to multi-core shared memory (OpenMP), cluster distributed memory (MPI), and SIMT GPU acceleration (CUDA).
- **Overhead Analysis**: Analyze communication latency in network-bound MPI clusters and host-to-device memory transfer overheads ($H2D$ / $D2H$) in CUDA.

## 2. Theoretical & Architectural Comparison

### 2.1 Architectural Breakdown

| Paradigm | Execution Model | Memory Space | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sequential** | Single-Threaded | Local CPU | Execution follows a traditional single-threaded, triple-nested loop ($O(N^3)$ complexity). Instructions run strictly sequentially on a single CPU core. |
| **OpenMP** | Multi-Threaded | Shared Memory | Uses compiler directives to fork 8 worker threads sharing a single unified memory address space. Loop iterations are dynamically divided. |
| **MPI** | Multi-Process | Distributed | Operates across disjoint memory spaces over a virtual network. Matrix A is scattered, Matrix B is broadcasted, and results are gathered. |
| **CUDA** | SIMT GPU | Device Memory | Offloads computation via PCIe bus. Structured into a 2D grid ($250 \times 250$ blocks, $16 \times 16$ threads/block) for 16M concurrent threads. |

---

## 3.  Workload Specification

- **Matrix Dimension ($N$)**: $4000 \times 4000$
- **Input Matrix $A$ & $B$**: $A[i][j] = 1.0, B[i][j] = 1.0$ for all $i, j$
- **Mathematical Operation**: $C[i][j] = \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} A[i][k] \times B[k][j]$
- **Expected Verification Value**:
  $$C[0][0] = \sum_{k=0}^{3999} (1.0 \times 1.0) = 4000.00$$

## 7.  Technical Analysis & Discussion

1. **Sequential CPU Baseline**: Serves as the computational baseline ($321.28\text{s}$). Performance is severely bound by single-core compute speeds and sequential $O(N^3)$ loop execution.
2. **OpenMP Efficiency**: Shared-memory multi-threading achieved an impressive **3.07× speedup** on 8 CPU threads ($\sim 99\%$ parallel efficiency). Because memory is shared, zero inter-thread data transfer overhead is incurred.
3. **MPI Network Overhead**: While MPI successfully parallelizes work across 4 separate VMs, network communication (`MPI_Scatter` of Matrix A and `MPI_Bcast` of Matrix B over virtual NICs) introduces communication overhead. Thus, speedup is $1.42\times$ compared to OpenMP's $3.07\times$.
4. **CUDA GPU Dominance**: (⏳ Pending benchmark execution)
